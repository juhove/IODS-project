# Chapter 3, Analysis Assigment 3

The analyses used in this chapter were somewhat known to me, however, the R packages and syntax are different from other languages. Thus, it is more than possible there would be a more elegant way of doing these analyses. I do like the markdown that's a combination of LaTeX and scripting.

Actually, today 19th of Nov I learned something new about the course, which is that there is something called Excercise Set including instructions for the assignments. Until this point, I have mainly used Google and R manual pages. Thus, it might be that the solutions below might vary somewhat from the way things are done in the course's solutions. Maybe with the Assigment 4 I'll first have a look at the Excercise Set 4...

Data is about alcohol consumption of students in secondary education of two Portuguese schools.

Data does have a matrix 370 (entries = persons) x 35 (columns = variables). Variables are both character variables and real numbers (double). There is one logical variable (high_use), however, several others are binary (or logical or categorical) variables but they have just imported as real numbers. There are no missing values.

Alcohol consumption (alc_use) ranges from $1.0$ to $5.0$, mean $1.9$ with sd $1.0$ and median $1.5$.

## 3 Variables and some plots

The four variables chosen to study with high/low alcohol comsumption (variable high_use that's alc_use \> 2): **7 Medu**, **14 studytime**, **21 higher**, and **24 famrel**.

-   7 Medu = mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education). **Hypothesis**: Mother's education has had influence on child's education, I reckon that higher education will decrease the alcohol consumption

-   14 studytime = weekly study time (numeric: 1 - \<2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - \>10 hours) **Hypothesis**: Higher the studytime per week lower the alcohol consumption (no time to drink)

-   21 higher = wants to take higher education (binary: yes or no) **Hypothesis**: If student wants to have higher education, probably they would be more inclined to study and not to drink that much. Mother's education might be a confounding factor here.

-   24 famrel = quality of family relationships (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - excellent) **Hypothesis**: Better the relationships with family, less alcohol consumption.

```{r}
# Import libraries for the plots
suppressWarnings({
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
})
# Not sure if this was needed, change the number values into character values for the plots
data_alc$Medu_char <- as.character(data_alc$Medu)
data_alc$studytime_char <- as.character((data_alc$studytime))
data_alc$famrel_char <- as.character(data_alc$famrel)

# I did some investigation using the alc_use as well, thou it's not a real continuous variable (ordinal scale?)
explanatory <- c("alc_use", "Medu_char", "studytime_char", "higher", "famrel_char")

# The values in question in vector to be used later on
select_explanatory <- c("high_use", "Medu_char", "studytime_char", "higher", "famrel_char")

#data_alc %>% remove_labels() %>% ggpairs(columns = explanatory)

#data_alc %>% select(all_of(explanatory)) %>% pivot_longer(-alc_use) %>% ggplot(aes(value, alc_use)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~name, scale = "free", ncol = 3) + coord_flip()
```
### Exploring the chosen variables using simple plots
Some simple bar plots to see how the high use of alcohol corresponds to the categories of the chosen variables. Made mainly to support the next task (no. 4).
```{r}
# Creating a bar plot with proportional values of high_use. 
data_alc %>% select(one_of(select_explanatory)) %>% pivot_longer(-high_use) %>% ggplot(aes(value, fill = high_use)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + ylab("proportion") + facet_wrap(~name, scale = "free", ncol = 2) + coord_flip()
```

## 4 Cross tabulations

Cross tabulations for the chosen variables vs. High Use of Alcohol. Comments after tables.

```{r}
# Cross tabs
# Load library
suppressWarnings({library(sjPlot)})

tab_xtab(var.row = data_alc$high_use, var.col = data_alc$famrel_char, title="High Use of Alcohol vs. Family relations", show.col.prc = TRUE)
```
Good family relations seem to have negative (well, one could argue that it's positive) on high_use on alcohol. Strangely enough though, the ones with the worst family conditions seems to fare just as good as the ones with the best family conditions. Otherwise the data is consistent, the better the family conditions less high use of alcohol. The famrel groups 1 and probably 2 are small (8 and 18 students) that effects the results. Not really sure if the hypothesis holds.

```{r}
tab_xtab(var.row = data_alc$high_use, var.col = data_alc$higher, title="High Use of Alcohol vs. Higher education aspirations", show.col.prc = TRUE)
```
Aspirations for higher education lowers the chance to have high use of alcohol. Hypothesis seems to hold. From cross-tabs it can be seen that the higher no subgroup is very small ($n=16$) compared to the yes group (n=354), which makes the results not so reliable.

```{r}
tab_xtab(var.row = data_alc$high_use, var.col = data_alc$Medu_char, title="High Use of Alcohol vs. Mother's education", show.col.prc = TRUE)
```
Mother's education does not have substantial effect on high use of alcohol, except that if mother does not have any education then students tend to use more alcohol. Again here the group 0 (no educatio) is small (n=3). After that the results are more or less the same. I think it's difficult to prove the hypothesis with these amount of students in group 0.

```{r}
tab_xtab(var.row = data_alc$high_use, var.col = data_alc$studytime_char, title="High Use of Alcohol vs. Study time", show.col.prc = TRUE)


```
Study time seems to have some association with use of alcohol. The ones using more tend to study less. With cross-tabs the similar pattern can be seen.

## 5 Model fit

Using finalfit package create univariable and multivariable tables Lower values (bad family relations, no aspiration for higher education, Mother has no education, least study time) will be the references.

```{r}
high_use_mod <- glm(high_use ~ famrel_char + higher + Medu_char + studytime_char, data = data_alc, family = binomial)



library(finalfit)
dependent <- "high_use"
explanatory <- c("famrel_char", "higher", "Medu_char", "studytime_char")

data_alc %>% finalfit(dependent, explanatory, metrics = TRUE) -> high_use_mod2

# Nicer looking table for knit and the html file
knitr::kable(high_use_mod2[[1]], row.names=FALSE, align=c("l", "l", "r", "r", "r", "r"))
knitr::kable(high_use_mod2[[2]], row.names=FALSE, col.names="")
```

### Odds ratio plot
```{r}
# Odds ratio plot
data_alc %>% or_plot(dependent, explanatory, breaks = c(0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25), table_text_size = 3.5, title_text_size = 16)

```

### Analysis of odds ratios
In univariable model the higher educational aspirations have p=0.019, however, when put into the multivariable model there is no statistical significant effect anymore. Probably due to low numbers of students how admitted low educational aspirations. Otherwise, the only statistically significant univariable model parameters were studytime 3 and 4.

It looks that the study time variable is the only one with statistically significant effect on the low or high alcohol consumption. Here the groups 3 and 4 have negative odds rations, and the absolute values, which are $0.26$ and $0.25$ in multivariable model, are less than $1$. This suggests that the students who spend more time studying have lower odds for using high amounts of alcohol than the ones studying only $<2$ hours per week.

Model R-square is just $0.1$ and adjusted R-square $0.075$. It seems that the model ain't that good.

## 6 model predictions

```{r}
# Calculate predictions using the general linear model
alc_high_pred <- predict(high_use_mod)
#alc_high_pred
#data_alc$high_use
#library(caret)

#conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(data=alc_high_pred, reference = data_alc$high_use)

#table(data_alc$high_use, alc_high_pred)

# Some data modifications that the data and the modeled data can be compared (different data types double vs. lgl)
glm_probs <- data.frame(probs = predict(high_use_mod, type="response"))
head(glm_probs)

# All data that has probability >0.5 will be classified as TRUE, other FALSE

glm_pred <- glm_probs %>% mutate(pred = ifelse(probs>.5, "TRUE", "FALSE"))

glm_pred$pred_lgl <- as.logical(glm_pred$pred)
glm_pred <- cbind(data_alc, glm_pred)
```

### 2x2 cross-tabulation predicted vs. data
```{r}
# 2x2 cross-tabulation positives vs. negatives, confusion matrix
# Predictions as columns, data (real values) as rows
# Fill 0 might be problematic (missing values noted as 0 => false), however, here we have no missing values.
glm_pred %>% count(pred_lgl, high_use) %>% spread(high_use, n, fill = 0)
```

2x2 cross-tabulation (or rather the general linear model) gives us as true positives (sensitivity) $\frac{22}{89+22}=0.198$, false positives $\frac{89}{22+89}=0.802$, true negatives (specificity) $\frac{244}{244+15}=0.942$, and false negatives $\frac{15}{244+15}=0.0579$ in cases. Model gave correct value in $244+22=266$ times out of $370$ succeeding in $\frac{266}{370}=0.719$ cases. Thus, the training error is $1-0.719 = 0.281 = 28.1\%$. Please note that here the training data and the validation data for the model is the same. Even though this is the case, a perfect model construction is not possible with this approach as the training error shows. Quite probably the test error (using the model for actual predictions for new data) would be larger.

The models sensitivity is certainly low $0.198$ that means that it is not good finding the cases where alcohol consumption is high. Specificity is better $0.942$ that means that the students with low use of alcohol will not be classified wrong as easily. I would not use this model for finding the high alcohol consumption students.

### ROC curve and AUC value

```{r}
suppressWarnings({library(pROC)})

# Calculating AUC and ROC 
roc_score <- roc(data_alc$high_use, alc_high_pred)
plot(roc_score, main = "ROC curve -- Logistic Regression")
roc_score # Print out AUC

```

ROC curve can be seen above. ROC graph has Sensitivity on y-axis and Specificity (normally 1-Specificity on x-axis, in this graph x-axis is inverted) on x-axis. The diagonal line represent the uniformative classifier or model that's no better than random. The best model in this graph would have curve going straight up from $x = 1.0$ to $y = 1.0$ and continuing rightwards at $y = 1.0$.

AUC (Area Under Curve) for the model (and predictions) is $0.70$, which is I think better than I anticipated. For random data (or uninformative classifier) the AUC should be $0.5$ (denoted but the diagonal line). Perfect model would have AUC value of $1$. Well, the model is better than random values.
