# Didn't really get to where the instruction  "copy the solution from the exercise "3.3 The if-else structure" to combine the 'duplicated' answers in the joined data " pointed to and I was too lazy to write any own solution

# 370 observations, 41 variables, high_use have two levels, alc_use median 1.5, mean 1.9, min 1 max 5 makes sense
# Still includes some *.x and *.y variables, don't know if these were supposed to get rid of in item 5, however, they are not duplicates

# Write out a csv file
