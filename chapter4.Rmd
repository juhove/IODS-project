# Chapter 4, Analysis Assigment 4

This week the assigments were again kinda familiar to me. I have used k-means clustering earlier, but not that many times as all kinds of regression analysis. Again, the R syntax is new. I had issues with cross tabulation data types. Finally, Google's AI Bard gave nice hints what to do and now it seems to work. AI tools seem to make coding much more efficient.

```{r}

```{r}
# Load libraries
suppressWarnings({

## 2 and 3 Loading data and checking it out

```{r}

# Load data
data("Boston")

# Data description
# Check the beginning of the data
head(Boston) 
# Some more indepth information regarding the data (variable types)
str(Boston)
# Dimensions of the data as a vector
dim_Boston <- dim(Boston)
dim_Boston

# Summary of the whole tibble, however, below I use ff_glimpse, I think it is easier to read.
summary(Boston)

# Missing data
# mean, sd, IQR, min/max values for appropriate variable types (numbers)
# number of categorical variables (leves_n) for charcter data
# Prints out the variable names as well. Data will be in two data frames: fisrt will have the information regarding the numeral value data and the second the variables that have character data.
ff_glimpse(Boston)
```

Boston tibble had 14 variables and 506 observation (rows). All variables
are numbers either real numbers or integers. Data is about the housing
values in the city of Boston in the US. Each row represents a Boston
suburb or town. 

### Data description 

Data from https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/Boston.html

Format This data frame contains the following columns:

-   crim per capita crime rate by town.

-   zn proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

-   indus proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

-   chas Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).

-   nox nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).

-   rm average number of rooms per dwelling.

-   age proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.

-   dis weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.

-   rad index of accessibility to radial highways.

-   tax full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000.

-   ptratio pupil-teacher ratio by town.

-   black $1000\times(B_kâˆ’0.63)^2$, where $B_k$ is the proportion of blacks by town.

-   lstat lower status of the population (percent).

-   medv median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
# Distributions and correlation between variables, quite a big plot with small graphs
Boston_pairs <- ggpairs(Boston)
Boston_pairs

```

```{r}
# Correlation matrix
correlation_Boston <- cor(Boston)
# Another correlation representation of correlation with colored circles
corrplot(correlation_Boston, method="circle")

```

About distributions

Age distribution is towards higher ages mean $69$ years, median $78$
years. Pupil-to-teacher ratio (pratio) shoots up, clearly not uniform
around Boston. At some areas houses seem to be huge compared to other as
(rm) rooms per dwelling peaks. Some areas some strong proportion of
black ethnicity and other areas don't have. Only variable that remotely
looking normally distributed at a glance is rm average number of rooms
per dwelling, however, taken the nature of that information, it is just
a coincidence.

-   Highest (simple) correlations can be found between

-   Age vs. distance to five Boston employment centres $r = 0.731$

-   Lower status of the population vs. Median value of owner-occupied
    homes $r=0.738$

-   Distance to five Boston employment centres vs. Nitrogen oxides
    concentration $r=0.769$

-   Full-value property-tax rate vs. Index of accessibility to radial
    highways $r=0.910$

It looks like that some areas are more polluted that are closer to
industry (makes sense). Also, it looks that some areas do have huge
houses compared to other and no wonder that those areas correlate with
higher median values of owner-occupied homes.

## 4. Scaling the dataset

```{r}
# Scaling (column_value - column_mean) / column_sd using scale function
# Data frame works better, otherwise output is simpler matrix
Boston_scaled <- as.data.frame(scale(Boston))
# Checking out the new table
head(Boston_scaled)
# Some summary values of the new table
summary(Boston_scaled)
```

All values will have mean value of $0$ and standard deviation of $1$ =\>
standardized dataset.

```{r}
# Creating a factor variable out of crime rate using the quantiles as the break points

Boston_scaled$crim <- as.numeric(Boston_scaled$crim)
# Check out the current values
summary(Boston_scaled$crim)
# Crim quantiles
Boston_crim_bins <- quantile(Boston_scaled$crim)
Boston_crim_bins
```

### Creating categorical variables

```{r}
# Create categorical variable with labels corresponding to the quantiles
crime <- cut(Boston_scaled$crim, breaks = Boston_crim_bins, labels = c("low","med_low","med_high","high"), include.lowest = TRUE)

# Removing original crim variable from the Boston_scaled tibble
Boston_scaled <- dplyr::select(Boston_scaled, -crim)

# Adding the new categorical data
Boston_scaled <- data.frame(Boston_scaled, crime)
```

### Creating the training and test data

```{r}
# Dividing the dataset training/test 80/20 

# Number of rows
dim_Boston[1]

# Sample size 80%, choose randomly 80% indexed
ind <- sample(dim_Boston[1], size = dim_Boston[1]*0.8)

# Training set out of Boston_scaled
train <- Boston_scaled[ind,]


```

## 5 Linear discriminant analysis using training data

Caterogical crime rate (crime) as target variable, all other variables
as predictor variables.

```{r}
# LDA as crime as the target variable  in the training data
lda.fit <- lda(crime ~ ., data=train)
# Print out the lda results
lda.fit

lda.arrows <- function(x, myscale = 1, arrow_heads = 0.1, color = "red", tex = 0.75, choices = c(1,2)){
  heads <- coef(x)
  graphics::arrows(x0 = 0, y0 = 0, 
         x1 = myscale * heads[,choices[1]], 
         y1 = myscale * heads[,choices[2]], col=color, length = arrow_heads)
  text(myscale * heads[,choices], labels = row.names(heads), 
       cex = tex, col=color, pos=3)
}

# Classes to numerical values
classes <- as.numeric(train$crime)

# Drawing LDA biplot
plot(lda.fit, dimen = 2)
lda.arrows(lda.fit, myscale = 2.5)
```

It's kinda hard to interpret the plot. There might be a another solution
as well. Let's try that.

```{r}
suppressWarnings({
library(devtools)
library(ggord)
  })
ggord(lda.fit, train$crime, arrow = 1)

```

At least from the latter the groups are easier to see.

## 6 Test set, predictions

### Test set

```{r}

# Test set out of Boston_scaled
test <-Boston_scaled[-ind,]

# Correct classes that will be removed from the test data
test_correct_classes <- as.data.frame(test$crime)
# Removing the correct classes
test <- dplyr::select(test, -crime)


```

### Predicting

```{r}
# Predict classes with test data (20%) of the whole data
lda.pred <- predict(lda.fit, newdata = test)

# I had trouble of getting the table function to work, it helped to convert the data frames into vectors that is below
test_pred_classes <- as.data.frame(lda.pred$class)

test_correct_classes_v <- unlist(test_correct_classes)
test_pred_classes_v <- unlist(test_pred_classes)

# Cross tabulating the results on crime rate
table(correct = test_correct_classes_v, predicted = test_pred_classes_v)
```
Cross tabulation of the crime rate predicted values using LDA vs. the correct values from the test data (extracted earlier).

Number of correct predictions is low $n=22$, med_low $n=15$, med_high $n=15$, and high $n=26$. Altogether $\frac{78}{102}=0.76$.  

Most the errors in the model prediction happend with group med_low predicted as low $n=9$ and med_high group predicted as med_low $n=6$.

76% success rate is okay, but not good I would say. The training data is small as is the test data, so better accuracy would be achieved using larger data sets. At least that's my hypothesis.

## 7 K-means Clustering

```{r}
# Boston data already loaded, standardization again as the Boston_scaled has been modified

Boston_scaled2 <- as.data.frame(scale(Boston))
Boston_scaled2$crim <- as.numeric(Boston_scaled2$crim)

# Euclidean distance matrix
dist_eu <- dist(Boston_scaled2, method = "euclidean")
summary(dist_eu)

# Manhattan distance matrix
dist_man <- dist(Boston_scaled2, method = "manhattan")
summary(dist_man)
```

```{r}
set.seed(13)
```

### K-means clustering with 4 cluster centers
```{r}
# k-means clustering
km <- kmeans(Boston_scaled2, centers = 4)

pairs(Boston_scaled2[1:6], col = km$cluster)
pairs(Boston_scaled2[6:10], col = km$cluster)
pairs(Boston_scaled2[10:14], col = km$cluster)
```

### K-means clustering with 3 cluster centers
```{r}
km <- kmeans(Boston_scaled2, centers = 3)

pairs(Boston_scaled2[1:6], col = km$cluster)
pairs(Boston_scaled2[6:10], col = km$cluster)
pairs(Boston_scaled2[10:14], col = km$cluster)
```
I think it's quite difficult to see from these plots what would be the optimal number of clusters. So, let's move to the next step to determine the optimal value using total of wihin cluster sum of squares (TWCS).


### Determining the k

Determining the optimal number of cluster centers from 1 to 10 using TWCS.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

# Setting maximum number of clusters to 10.
k_max <- 10

# Calculating TWCSS
twcss <- sapply(1:k_max, function(k){kmeans(Boston_scaled2, k)$tot.withinss})

# Plotting the TWCSS vs. number of clusters
qplot(x = 1:k_max, y = twcss, geom = 'line')
```

The optimal number of cluster centers is where the TWCSS drops rapidly.
In the plot above there seems to be two possible linear trends that
could fit there. One $k \in [ 1:2]$ and the other $k \in [2:10]$. Thus,
\$ k = 2\$ seems to be the optimal number of clusters.

```{r}
# K-means with the supposedly optimal 2 cluster centers
km <- kmeans(Boston_scaled2, centers = 2)

```

### Pairwise plots with k-means and two cluster centers

```{r}
# ggpairs seems to give nicer looking graphs
km_ggpairs <- ggpairs(Boston_scaled2, aes(color=as.factor(km$cluster), alpha = 0.5))
print(km_ggpairs, progress = F)


ggpairs(Boston_scaled2, columns=1:6, aes(color=as.factor(km$cluster), alpha = 0.5))
ggpairs(Boston_scaled2, columns=6:10, aes(color=as.factor(km$cluster), alpha = 0.5))
ggpairs(Boston_scaled2, columns=10:14, aes(color=as.factor(km$cluster), alpha = 0.5))
```

The plot with all the pairs is nice in that way that all pairs are
there, however, it's really cramped and there ain't much of a chance to
see the correlations. Nevertheless, there's some information to be
gathered.

**Good separation with two classes can be seen in variables:**

-   indus = proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

-   nox = nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).

-   tax = full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000.

**A resonable good separation with two classes in variables:**

-   pratio = pupil-teacher ratio by town.

-   lstat = lower status of the population (percent).

-   medv (some separation) = median value of owner-occupied homes in
    \$1000s.

-   rad = index of accessibility to radial highways.

**No separation between two classes in variables:**

-   zn = proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000
    sq.ft.

-   chas = Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0
    otherwise).

-   rm = average number of rooms per dwelling.

-   black = $1000 \times (B_kâˆ’0.63)^2$, where $B_k$ is the proportion of
    blacks by town.
    
I think the best clustering with the two cluster centers can be seen in tax variable. It would seem that in Boston there are those who have lots of property to tax and those who don't have. The middle is kinda empty. Also, there seems to be places with high non-retail businesses and some places with low number. 

When looking at the correlations most are low.

-   tax vs. rad correlate highly in cluster no $2$ $r=0.869$

-   rm vs. medv correlate highly in cluster no $1$ $r=0.893$

It was seen earlier already that the tax and rad correlated highly. Perhaps this has to do with some highways been close to some expensive areas.
